# Years-Till-100

This is an app that tells you how many years it will take until you turn 100.
To run this app, simply run the python file. And then follow through the input options.

Currently this is just a simple command line, text based program. 
But I do plan to play around with either formatting it to look much nicer, or adding a graphical interface. 
The purpose of this was just really as a bit of an excersice to get me back into programming
